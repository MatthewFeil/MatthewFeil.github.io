<p>It’s almost time for finals! Many students including myself will be studying hard, trying to get the best grades they can. But sometimes you don’t have enough time to study for everything, and you have to decide what to study and what to skip. It can be helpful know what grade you will end up with after the final, because a 97% and a 93% (both A’s) have the same GPA. My school gives a confusing and repetitive equation students can use to calculate their final grade, with the semester grade weighing 80% and the final exam 20%. I decided to see if ChatGPT could make a website to calculate your grades easily. It worked suprisingly well. So here’s the website it made with minimal revision by myself. All you have to do is input your current semester grade, and it will tell you what  you need to get on the final for each letter grade, and it will also say if the grade is impossible or guarnteed!</p>]]></content><author><name>Matthew Feil</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Try the calculator here!]]></summary></entry></feed>
