Hey there! I'm a freshman in high school, and I learning music, audio technology, and coding. I have been playing piano for nine years, trombone for four, and both baritone and bass guitar for a year. I love to learn about audio technology, and I mix for my church occasionally, and I also mixed for my junior high's musical when I was in eighth grade. I got into coding more recently, and with some help from my dad, some YouTube videos, and a little help from ChatGPT, I made this website.
